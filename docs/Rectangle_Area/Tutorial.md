# Tutorial 

Below are tutorials for running the adder function using a python interface or command line. Before starting
both, ensure area_function.py is downloaded to your device. In both tutorials, we will learn how to run the function "area_function" which computes the area of a 
rectangle. We will do 
this for a rectangle of width 2 and height 3.

# Tutorial for using a python interface.
1.  Open VSCode, Conda, or preferred code editor.
2.  Open a blank script.
3.  Import area_function into the script with the line: import area_function as area
4.  Call the function for a rectangle of width 2, height 3. Call the function with the line: z=area(2,3)
5.  Add a line to check the output: print("width*height=: ", z)
6.  Run the script.

If the output does not show 6, double check the function was called correctly.

# Tutorial for command line
1. Open command line/terminal
2. Go to the directory where the function area_function.py is downloaded.
3. Open python by entering "python" in command line. Hit enter. A new line should show up below, indexed by>>>
3. Call the function by typing: area_function() on the command line.
4. Hit enter to run
5. The output should display "6". If it does not, check you entered the inputs correctly.

If the output does not show 6, double check the function was called correctly.
