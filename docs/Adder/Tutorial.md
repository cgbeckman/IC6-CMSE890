# Tutorial 

Below are tutorials for running the adder function using a python interface or command line. Before starting 
both, ensure adder.py is downloaded to your device. In both tutorials, we will learn how to call the python 
function my_adder to sum 3 integers. 

# Tutorial for using a python interface. 
1.  Open VSCode, Conda, or preferred code editor. 
2.  Open a blank script.
3.  Import adder.py into the script with the line: import adder 
4.  We will call the function to add the numbers 1, 2, and 3. Call the function with the line: z=adder(1,2)
5.  Add a line to check the output: print("1+2+3=: ", z)
6.  Run the script. 

If the output does not show 6, double check the function was called correctly. 

# Tutorial for command line
1. Open command line/terminal 
2. Open python by entering "python" in command line. Hit enter. A new line should show up below, indented with >>>
3. Import the function using the line: from adder import my_adder  
3. Call the function by typing: my_adder(1,2,3) on the command line. 
4. Hit enter to run
5. The output should display "6". If it does not, check you entered the inputs correctly.
