# Tutorial 

This page will walk you through how to use the Adder Function. 

Before starting this tutorial, make sure the adder function has been downloaded and saved as "adder.py".
## Using a python interface
1) Open a new script in python. This can be done with an interface such as VSCode, or Conda.
3) Import the adder function with the line: import adder 
2) For this tutorial, we will use 1 and 2 as our inputs. Call the adder function with the line: z=adder(1,2)
3) Run the script. The output should be 3, as 1+2=3. 

## Using command line/terminal
1) Go to the directory where adder.py is saved.
2) In your command line, type <adder(1,2)>
3) Hit enter.
4) The output should be 3 (1+2=3).
